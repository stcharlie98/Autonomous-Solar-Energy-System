In this project, were used:

1. Solar energy panel with Li-Ion battery;
2. 3D printing through AutoCAD;
3. Microcontroller ESP-WROOM-32 (Arduino IDE);
4. Sensors to measure humidity (%), temperature (Â°C) and luminosity (lux);
5. Other components (resistors, step-up 5V, TP4056, Arduino for testing purposes etc.);
6. Soldering on a PCB Circuit Board.

I learned a lot with my team through problem solving about one of my favorite subjects: renewable energy. On doing so, the project was highly graded and could be used in my applications in real life. The most exciting part, after making it all work, was making it a real low energy gadget, more information are available in the .pdf file.
