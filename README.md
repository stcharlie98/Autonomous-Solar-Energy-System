In this project, were used:

1. Solar energy panel;
2. 3d printing upon drawing in the AutoCAD;
3. Microcontroller ESP-WROOM-32 (Arduino IDE);
4. Sensors to measure humidity, temperature and luminosity;
5. Other components (resistors, step-up, TP4056, Arduino etc.);
6. Soldering on a PCB Circuit Board.

I learned with my team through problem solving a lot about one of my favorite subjects: renewable energy. On doing so, the project was highly graded and could be used in my applications in real life.
